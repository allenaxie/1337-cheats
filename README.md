# 1337 Cheats

## Project Summary

1337 Cheats is an app designed to help people learn new coding concepts by way of ‚Äúcheat sheets‚Äù. As former students ourselves, we noticed our desktops filling up with tons of notes and resource pages to reference later on. Every time we took notes we thought to ourselves, what if someone else has already taken the time to do this? This led to us brainstorming a way for avid learners to share their favorite resources that have helped them learn to code. 1337 Cheats allows users to upload images of their ‚Äúcheat sheets‚Äù and share them with other students. Auuthorized users have the ability to "favorite" certain posts so that they can reference them later. With the click of a button, you can help other students too.
